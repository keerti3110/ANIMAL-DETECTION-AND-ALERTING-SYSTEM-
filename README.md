# ANIMAL-DETECTION-AND-ALERTING-SYSTEM-
# Animal Detection and Alerting System

*Main Objective:*  
To prevent animal deaths due to train collisions on *forest railway tracks* by detecting wild animals in real-time using machine learning and alerting systems like buzzers and LCD displays.

This system uses a model trained in *Pictoblox* to identify wild animals such as *tiger, **elephant, and **bear* from a live laptop camera. When a targeted animal is detected, a *buzzer is triggered, and the animal’s name is displayed on an **I2C LCD module*.

## Real-World Applications

- *Forest Railway Tracks* (Main Use Case)  
  Detect animals approaching the railway track and trigger alarms, helping to alert train operators and avoid fatal accidents.

- *Tourist Zones in Forests*  
  Can be used to alert tourists 2–3 km in advance through wireless modules when wild animals are detected.

- *Villages Near Forests*  
  Early warnings for nearby villagers when dangerous animals approach their surroundings, helping to protect lives and crops.
